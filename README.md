# hello-world

This is just the beginning.

Hello, everyone! I am Brandon Bien-Aime, a second-year Computer Information Systems student, from Miami, Florida. I attend Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. I have been coding for a year now and I want to increase my experience so I can become a Front-End Developer. Within a year, I learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. My goal is to collaborate with many people around the world; people who can teach me things I need to know, and so on. My goal right now is to continue to learn more about Javascript, and I would love to learn Python as well.
